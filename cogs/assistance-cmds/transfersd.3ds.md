Moving SD cards on a 3DS is easy.
First, ensure the new SD card is in the FAT32 format.
If it is not in the FAT32 format, follow the intructions here to format it:

Once the new card is FAT32, move all your content from the old SD to the new SD.
IMPORTANT: Do not put the new SD card in the console before moving all your data to it.
