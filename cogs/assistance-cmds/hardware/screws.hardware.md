Are you using the proper bit? Most Nintendo consoles use JIS screws, NOT Philips (PH) screws.

Sometimes, using a bit one size larger than the screw will allow the screw to turn.

If your screws are stripped, and you're looking to replace them, be sure to buy a set of high-quality screws. Most sets of replacement screws (i.e., eXtremeRate screws) are soft and will strip easily.
