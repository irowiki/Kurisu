Do you want to mod or repair your system by yourself? Before you start, consider the following:
* Are you proficient and familiar enough with electronic repairs to avoid damaging your system?
* Do you have the right tools available to you? (see https://discord.com/channels/196618637950451712/233002779717795850/1146584298191851582 for a list of tools).
* Do you have enough experience soldering (if applicable)?
* Do you have enough experience using power tools (if applicable)?

If you're interested in learning how to repair consoles or (micro)solder, keep in mind that tools cost money and building experience takes time. In most cases, sending your console in for repairs is usually cheaper and faster. You should NOT attempt (micro)soldering on devices you care about without prior experience.

Would you rather have a professional repair your console? Or are you looking to buy a pre-modded console? Search for repair shops near you, or alternatively, see [this list of trusted repairers and modders](https://pastebin.com/FAiczew4).
