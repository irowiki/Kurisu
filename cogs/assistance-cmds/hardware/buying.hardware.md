Are you planning on buying a console or replacement parts? Here are some pointers to keep in mind:
* Use eBay to buy consoles or OEM replacement parts. Even if something goes wrong with your purchase, eBay has a solid "Money Back Guarantee" policy.
* Use eBay, Amazon, or AliExpress for 3rd party replacement parts. AliExpress will most likely be your cheapest option, but also the slowest shipping-wise.
* Do NOT buy batteries from either Amazon or AliExpress, and do NOT buy any type of storage (i.e., SD cards) from AliExpress.
* There is a risk of buying a reshelled console without the seller properly disclosing this. Reshelled consoles might be difficult to identify in images. Compare images of the console you're interested in buying to images on [Consolevariations](https://consolevariations.com).
