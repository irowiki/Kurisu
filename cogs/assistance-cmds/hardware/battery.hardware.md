Has the battery life of your handheld drastically decreased\*? Or is your battery looking puffed up and swollen? It might be time to replace your battery. In the latter case of swelling, you MUST replace your battery and safely dispose of your old battery as soon as you can, as swollen batteries can pose a safety hazard and potentially explode.

Replacement batteries for Nintendo's handheld systems can be purchased from iFixit (https://ifixit.com) \*\*. These systems include the DS Lite, DSi, DS 2DS, 3DS, Switch (OLED), and variations. Do NOT purchase 3rd party replacement batteries from retailers such as Amazon, eBay, and AliExpress. These batteries almost always advertise fake capacities, have quality control issues, and break down after a few months.

When using a new DS/2DS/3DS battery, be sure to calibrate it first. As noted by iFixit:
"For optimal performance, calibrate your newly installed battery: Charge it to 100% and keep charging it for at least 2 more hours. Then use your device until it shuts off due to low battery. Finally, charge it uninterrupted to 100%". For calibrating Switch batteries, read more here: https://discord.com/channels/196618637950451712/467801334373023744/1256118057177186434.
 
\* A list of approximated battery durations can be found [here for the 3DS family systems](https://en-americas-support.nintendo.com/app/answers/detail/a_id/385/~/how-long-will-the-battery-remain-charged), and [here for the switch](https://www.nintendo.com/en-gb/Support/Nintendo-Switch/How-Long-Does-the-Battery-Charge-Last-1630015.html).

\*\* Unfortunately, some quality control issues have been reported with a few iFixit batteries, as a few batteries have broken down after a few months of use. Potentially cheaper, and more reliable batteries from another source are currently being tested by Wurmatron. However, as of now, iFixit is still the recommended option for replacement batteries. If you notice any issues with your iFixit battery, claim your 1-year warranty from iFixit and let us in #hardware know for logging purposes.
