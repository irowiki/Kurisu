Replacement shells for most systems can be found on AliExpress (cheap, slow shipping) and Amazon (more expensive, but faster shipping). It is noteworthy that most, if not all, third-party shells are of subpar quality compared to OEM shells. Therefore, it is recommended not to replace your OEM shell unless it is absolutely necessary.

For DS, 2DS, and 3DS handhelds, most third-party shell replacements are of similar quality. There is little difference between brands regarding plastic quality and quality control. Transparent shells tend to have a higher risk of cracking, as the mix of plastics used for transparency makes them more fragile than non-transparent colors.

For the Switch (OLED), eXtremeRate is the recommended brand for replacement shells. There are also unbranded aluminum shell parts available for various Switch systems, which seem to be of decent quality as well.

For the GB, GBC, GBA, and GBA SP, replacement parts (including shells) from [FunnyPlaying](https://funnyplaying.com) are recommended.
